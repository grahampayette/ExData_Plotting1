## Introduction

The source data for these programs can be found at:

"https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip""

Download and unzip the main file household_power_consumption.txt in to a data directory from your root.

## Loading the data

The assignment has been completed per the instructions for programming assignment #1 for Course 4 (exploratory data analysis) for the Data Science specialization.  

1) Download the data
2) download/upload/source any of the .R files in to R-studio
3) execute makePlotX("plotX.png") at your command line (substituting a number from 1-4 for X)


Does nothing fancy but you should have a .png output that looks like the samples uploaded by the instructor.
